The LGPL, under which this project is licensed, makes Rygal

You may ask, why the engine uses LGPL instead of GPL, well the
reason is very simple, projects that are licensed under the
terms of GPL aren't allowed to be used - even as a library - in
projects that are using other licenses than GPL. The LGPL gives
you the right to use this library in your project, no matter
under which license your project is.
